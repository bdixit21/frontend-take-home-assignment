# gStudio Frontend Take Home Assignment

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for your interest in working with us! The next step in our hiring process is a virtual code interview. Below you will see 3 questions and a code work section. We ask you to record yourself answering the 3 questions and your screen when code sharing with Loom ([http://loom.com/](http://loom.com/)). Loom is a free video recording software that will provide you links which you will send us. Please send us 1 video link, answering the questions and explaining your code structure.

**Something things to keep in mind:**

- We recommend you do a practice run so that you can get accustomed with Loom's software and our questions. Reading the "Code Share Checklist" and "Code Share Questions" beforehand will help pick the best project to share.
- Please be sure your audio is clear and your camera is on when you answer the questions. You will need to create a second video that records your screen for the code share.
- Contact me (Jair) if you have issues with the assigment.
