### Expectations
- We expect you to read the chakra-ui docs, and use their design system to create the components

- If we exchange the theme, your components should respect it

### Questions
- How will you organize the interface components and name them?
- How will you document the components?
- How will you handle the design system usage?
- How would you organize your components in a scalable application architecture? 
- How would you make your component change with provided variants for itself?

# Development Instructions
